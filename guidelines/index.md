# Overview of Budget & Service Guidelines

Various factors contribute to the cost of your menu, including the type of food and presentation you desire, your guest count, the venue you have chosen, and the season.

Providing excellent service to you and your guests is of utmost importance to us. Our highly-trained, attentive staff, and server/bartender to guest ratios assure that we meet that goal.

Although a specific quote cannot be determined until after your consultation and a location walk-through, you can find some guidelines on service and pricing in the left column.
