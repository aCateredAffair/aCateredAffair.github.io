# All About Our Company

_A Catered Affair_ is a family-owned local business, continuing with pride our father's catering venture. Collectively we have over 40 years experience in the restaurant and catering worlds. We are dedicated to excellence and service. It is our philosophy that high quality cuisine combined with beautiful, creative presentation and impeccable personal service is something that every client deserves.

Customer service and satisfaction is of utmost importance to us at A Catered Affair. That service begins with attention to detailâ€” whether it is the details of how a bride would like the reception hall set up, listening to a client's desired menu while being sensitive to their budget, or checking the freshness of each food product that is purchased. It continues by inspection to insure the quality and presentation of each finished dish as it leaves the kitchen. Our impeccable service continues though an attentive, service-focused staff that has gained the reputation of exceeding our guests' every expectation.
