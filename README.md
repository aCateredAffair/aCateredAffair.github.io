## Hey ma!

You can edit the contents of the pages by navigating into each folder.
If you edit the `index.md` file (or any file) and save it, that will change the website in real time. Pretty awesome, I think.

Site is hosted by github at:

* http://aCateredAffair.github.io
* http://tccatering.us

## Developing

Run the dev environment:

    jekyll serve --watch

Deploy the app with a git commit and push. Github autobuilds jekyll and hosts from the master branch.
