# Suggestions for Menus

A Catered Affair uses only the finest ingredients—utilizing artisan foods, local purveyors, and organic produce whenever possible. We also recognize that the best quality food is served right after it is prepared. For that reason, we specialize in preparing your food at your location, rather than transporting it to your location and holding it warm. We want the food at your event to be perfect no matter what the limitations of the location may be—even if it means encouraging you to choose a different item for your menu.

Following are a few samples of menus that we have created for our clients in the past. Please remember that these are just suggestions to spark your imagination. We will create a personalized menu for your special occasion that compliments your taste, matches your theme, and fits within your budget.
